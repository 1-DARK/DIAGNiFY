                The table should have the following columns in this exact order: Disease, possibility.

                Structure the response as a complete HTML `<table>` element, including `<thead>` for headers and `<tbody>` for the rows.

                Output ONLY the HTML `<table>` element and its full content. Do not include any surrounding text, markdown code blocks (like ```html), or any other characters before or after the HTML table code.

                Example structure of the HTML you should generate (use the actual meal plan data for the content):

                ```html
                <table>
                <thead>
